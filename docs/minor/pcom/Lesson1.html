<h2> What is language? </h2>
<p>
A system of conventional spoken, manual or written symbols by means of which human beings, as members of <i> <span title="Questionable grammar/No article: 'social' will be forced to take the identity of a proper noun whereas the implied meaning is an improper non-specific noun."> * social group </span> </i> and participants in its culture.
</p>
<p>
A language can only be called a language if it has a system of rules (also known as grammar), a sound system (phonology), a vocabulary (lexicon). These are the requirements for identifying a means of communication as a language.
</p>

<h2> Speech community </h2>
<p>
It is a term in sociolinguistic and linguistic anthropology used to describe a group of people who share the same language, speech characteristic and ways of interpreting communication.
</p>

<h2> Language acquisition </h2>
<ul>
 <li> The process by which <i> <span title="Subject-verb agreement/ Original: 'human acquire'"> * humans acquire </span> </i> the capacity to perceive and comprehend language.
 </li> <li> Language acquisition is one of the quintessential human traits, because <i> <span title="Subject-verb agreement/ Original: 'non-human do not communicate"> * non-humans do not communicate </span> </i> by using language.
 </li> <li> While growing up people acquire the languages used by those in the community.
 </li>
</ul>

<h2> First language/ Mother tongue </h2>
<ul>
 <li> A language that is not the native language of the speaker, but that is used in the locale of a person.
 </li> <li> The languages acquired while growing up <i> <span title="Spelling error/ Original: 'are know as'"> * are known as </span> </i> mother tongues, which is also referred to as first languages.
 </li> <li> In contrast, a foreign language is a language <i> <span title="Original: 'that learned in an where that'"> * learned where that </span> </i> language has no presence or is not commonly spoken by the community as a whole.
 </li>
</ul>

<h2> Second language </h2>
<ul>
 <li> A language that is not the native language of the speaker, but that is used in the locale of a person.
 </li> <li> In contrast, a foreign language is a language <i> <span title="Original: 'that learned in an where that'"> * learned where that </span> </i> language has no presence or is not commonly spoken by the community as a whole.
 </li>
</ul>

<h2> Language learning </h2>
<ul>
 <li> This includes language teaching options which are available to interested students, some of which may have focus <i> <span title="No article on a countable noun/ Original: 'on specific topic'"> * on a specific topic </span> </i> or enhancement of selected skills.
 </li> <li> People learn languages by studyinging formally in school or informally on their own.
 </li>
</ul>

<h2> Language contact </h2>
<ul>
 <li> Your own language may also change as you interact and communicate with each other.
 </li> <li> For example, <i> <span title="Bad language/ Original: you speak using your mother tongue and English, speak to foreigners, but eventually will be able to communicate and will slowly learn each other's languages"> * you speak using your mother tongue while foreigners speak back in English. Eventually both parties will be able to communicate and slowly learn each other's languages.</span> </i>
 </li>
</ul>

<h2> Language change </h2>
<ul>
 <li> Your own language may also change as you interact and communicate with each other.
 </li> <li> For example, you and your foreign friend will produce a new language that is understandable to both of you.
 </li>
</ul>
